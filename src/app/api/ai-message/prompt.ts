export const defaultPrompt=`Generate exactly three open-ended and engaging questions as a single string.
Each question must be separated by ||.

These questions are intended for an anonymous social messaging platform (similar to Qooh.me), and should be:

Universally relatable and safe for all audiences

Friendly, positive, and curiosity-driven

Free of personal, controversial, or sensitive topics (no religion, politics, relationships, or identity-based questions)

Encouraging meaningful, light-hearted interaction that helps people express thoughts or stories

Format your final response exactly like this:

"Question 1||Question 2||Question 3"

Example:
"What’s a hobby you’ve recently started?||If you could have dinner with any historical figure, who would it be?||What’s a simple thing that makes you happy?"

Your goal is to make each question feel natural, intriguing, and welcoming — something that anyone would enjoy answering.`
